# Data Structures
## Nodes
- have data and link to next node
- if the link is None, we are at the end of the node path we were following
- img
## Linked List
- uni or bidirectional
- comprised of nodes
- head and tail nodes
- data and link to next node
## Double Linked List
- comprised of nodes
- two pointers:
    - one for next node
    - one for previous node
- head previous node is set to null
- tail next node is set to null
